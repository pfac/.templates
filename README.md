My Templates
============

Since I don't enjoy the whole thing of searching for skeletons of files, be it configuration or anything else, and I get specially frustrated when I have to search for the same thing more than once, here's me saving all the crap I need, as I need it.

Feel free to use it as you please (MIT licensed).
